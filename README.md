2.  **Standardization:** Corrected inconsistent entries (e.g., date formats and category naming).
3.  **Data Enrichment:** Created new calculated fields including `Month`, `Year`, and `Age Bracket`.
4.  **Table Structuring:** Converted the dataset into a **Structured Excel Table** for dynamic pivot operations.

## 🧭 Strategic Recommendations
### 1. Sales & Marketing
* **Seasonal Campaigns:** Replicate the "March–April" success with targeted marketing pushes during festive seasons.
* **Off-Peak Incentives:** Introduce discount campaigns or "Flash Sales" between August and December to stabilize revenue.
* **Male Demographic:** Launch a "Men’s Fashion Fest" to bridge the gap in male-oriented sales.

### 2. Operational Improvement
